Cellular Automata 2D
=====================
Small C# application created to get a credit on my university. Project has implemented Cellular Automata 2D with The Game of Life mode.

## How it works?
This is simple application with GUI, all what you need to do is compile the project and set correct values using dropdowns, textboxes and by mouse clicks on the canvas.

Project contains 500x500 grid, but you can simply adjust this in `Interface.cs`. Implementation is really scalable and flexible.

## Is it properly implementation?
Yes, but there can be some edge cases where apllication can be crashed.

## Can I use it?
Sure, the code is shared on MIT License. However, **I would be grateful for a star** in the project.

## What has been used to created it?
Software created with love to coding in Cracow.
* IDE: Visual Studio 2017,
* OS: Windows 10.

## Can we talk about the implementation?
Sure. I am open to teach you and make the code clearer, so you can reach the goal.
